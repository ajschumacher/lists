> Pier 39 - more tourist central and scores of fat sea lions for you to stare at.

> Alcatraz - Maybe we can take a tour together - i have never been there is supposed to be a scary night tour.

> Also Bay cruises

> Powell St. and Union Square, a bunch of shopping, street performers and tourist stuff, plus you can ride the old trolley cars up insane steep hills. There is an alley way of 3 restaurants there I like called Cafe Claude, Claudine and Gitane.

> Explore the city it is very walkable/public transitable.

> I like downtown bars and restaurants too, Twitter, Uber and other Techs have moved their headquarters there so there are a lot of fun new places to try.

> rent a car and maybe visit Sonoma, Napa,  Healdsburg or head south to Pescadero or Half Moon Bay

> Take Caltrain to Silcon Valley?

> There are probably festivals or events going on too, this list could be a start?

> Point Reyes there is hiking and elk/various wildlife there and there is an island called Tomales bay for BBQing oysters (within 1 hour of SF by car)
