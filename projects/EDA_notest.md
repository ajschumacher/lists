# EDA notes

tallying system (not actually original, though could have been independently invented)

Abnormal law of large numbers page 15

these are largely EDA book notes...

EDA p. v (Preface): "A basic problem about any body of data is to make it more easily and effectively handleable by minds--our minds, her mind, his mind."

possible titles:
Data Minding
Perceiving Data

EDA p. vi (Preface): "Consistent with this view, we believe, is a clear demand that pictures based on exploration of data should *force* their messages upon us. Pictures that emphasize what we already know--"security blankets" to reassure us--are frequently not worth the space they take. Pictures that have to be gone over with a reading glass to see the main point are wasteful of time and inadequate of effect. **The greatest value of a picture** is when it *forces* us to notice **what we never expected to see.**

EDA p. vii (Preface, on confirmatory vs. exploratory analysis): "The best way to **understand what CAN be done is no longer**--if it ever was--**to ask what things could,** in the current state of our skill techniques, **be confirmed** (positively or negatively). Even more understanding is *lost* if we consider each thing we can do to data *only* in terms of some set of very restrictive assumptions under which that thing is best possible--assumptions we *know we C A N N O T check in practice*."

exploratory is necessary; the problem isn't that we're failing to infer or to model, it's that we just don't know what's in the data

OH MY GOD YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND COUNTS AND PERCENTAGES AND HOW THEY COMBINE!!!

hierarchical histograms etc.
